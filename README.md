COVID-19-QR-Attendance-System is a system that uses SQLite relational database management system and is composed of a mobile QR code generator where it generates code on your phone and containing basic information and health declaration form, and a desktop application where the generated QR code will be scanned to record attendance.

QR attendance desktop application is activated by entering the email and password provided for the institution. After successful login, students can now scan their generated QR codes to record their attendance consisting of their basic information, student number, course and section, and time of QR generation. Each successful scan will make the screen of the desktop application display the photo of the students and their information. Also, students are required to scan their QR codes again before leaving the school premises to record their departure time.
The desktop application also has the functionality to add a student to the database and export the attendance record to an excel file.
